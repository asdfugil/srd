# Welcome to Hoyt's SRD Repo
```
Hi! 
I am David Hoyt. 
I was in the Apple Security Research Device Program for 2021 & 2022.
Apple sent me an iPhone 11 & iPhone 12 for A/B testing, very helpful. 
I still update various Code, Tooling, Script, Crashes and PoC's etc..
I am still processing over 100Tb of Data generated during those 2 years with thousands of Crashes. 
Some of the Code and Goodies are in this Repo
```
